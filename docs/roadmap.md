---

This roadmap is a strategic outline, not a fixed schedule. Phases may overlap; priorities may shift with official guidance, user feedback, and resource availability. Each phase builds on the previous one.

---

## Phase 1: Authority foundation

**Goal:** Establish afetoncesi.com as a trusted, findable, and technically solid reference for disaster preparedness in Türkiye.

**Focus areas:**

- **Content completeness:** All core hazard pages (earthquake, flood, fire, landslide, avalanche, storm, lightning, tsunami) have clear “before / during / after” guidance with official citations. Key topics (e.g. “deprem anında ne yapmalı,” acil çanta, toplanma alanı) are covered and kept up to date.
- **Discoverability:** Strong SEO, clear information architecture, sitemaps, and hreflang so that people searching for preparedness in Turkish or English can find the right page quickly.
- **Trust signals:** Transparent “about” and “how we work” (or equivalent), clear disclaimer that we are not official/emergency service, visible citation policy, and optional “last updated” or review dates where useful.
- **Technical baseline:** Fast, mobile-first site; no critical accessibility regressions; canonical URLs and redirects in place so links remain stable.

**Success indicators:** Organic traffic to preparedness pages, low bounce on key flows, positive feedback on clarity and trust, and no conflicts with official messaging.

## Phase 2: Education expansion

**Goal:** Deepen educational value and reach without compromising trust or simplicity.

**Focus areas:**

- **Broader topics:** Expand into adjacent themes where official or authoritative sources exist: e.g. first-aid basics (with clear “not a substitute for training” disclaimer), psychological first aid signposting, school/workplace preparedness, vulnerable groups (elderly, children, people with disabilities), and pets/livestock where applicable.
- **Structured learning:** Optional “paths” or checklists (e.g. “first 30 days,” “family plan in 4 steps”) that link to existing pages and official resources, without adding pressure or fake urgency.
- **Partnerships:** Formal or informal collaboration with NGOs, local government, or educational bodies to distribute or reference our content, with clear attribution and no commercial strings that violate our principles.
- **Multilingual consistency:** Keep TR as primary; ensure EN content stays in sync for key pages so international users and organisations can rely on the same quality.

**Success indicators:** Use of content in training or community programmes, increased depth of engagement (e.g. completing checklists), and sustained alignment with official sources after review.

## Phase 3: Equipment guidance

**Goal:** Help people understand what to have on hand (and why) without turning the site into a storefront.

**Focus areas:**

- **Needs-first guidance:** Content that explains what to prepare (e.g. water, food, documents, first-aid, communication) and in what order of priority, based on official or widely accepted guidance (e.g. 72-hour principle, AFAD lists).
- **Product-agnostic categories:** Describe *types* of items (e.g. “water container,” “battery-powered radio”) rather than pushing specific brands. Any future product links will follow the monetisation plan and be clearly separated.
- **Where to buy (optional):** If we ever link to retailers or marketplaces, it will be in a dedicated section (e.g. “where to find these items”), with ethical affiliate rules and no influence on core “what to do” content.
- **Review protocol:** Any equipment-related content is reviewed for accuracy, source alignment, and separation from commercial interest at least as strictly as other editorial content.

**Success indicators:** Users report that equipment guidance is clear and useful; no confusion between “what to do” and “what to buy”; affiliate/commerce policy (if adopted) is followed in practice.

---

## Phase 4: Platform and app ecosystem

**Goal:** Optionally extend reach and utility through tools or apps while keeping the core site a stable, free, and principle-aligned resource.

**Focus areas:**

- **Progressive enhancement:** Consider lightweight tools that add value without locking core information behind an app: e.g. printable checklists, simple “am I ready?” flows that link back to existing pages, or shareable “top 5 steps” cards.
- **Optional native/offline:** If an app or PWA is built, it should mirror the same principles (official-source-based, no fear-based content, clear separation from commerce). Offline or low-bandwidth access can support use in challenging conditions.
- **Ecosystem, not lock-in:** Any third-party apps or integrations that use our name or content must adhere to our content standards and product principles. We do not endorse or take responsibility for external tools that distort our messaging or add fear-based or commercial pressure.
- **Sustainability:** The core site remains free. Any premium or donor-supported features (if any) are clearly defined and do not gate essential preparedness information.

**Success indicators:** Broader reach and usability (e.g. in areas with poor connectivity); no dilution of trust or principle compliance; clear boundaries between “afetoncesi.com official” and “powered by / inspired by” use.

## Cross-cutting priorities

- **Official alignment:** After major official updates (e.g. AFAD, MGM), review and update affected pages promptly.
- **User feedback:** Use feedback and analytics (within privacy and principle limits) to improve clarity and fix errors, not to maximise engagement at the cost of trust.
- **Documentation:** Keep vision, product principles, content standards, and monetisation plan up to date so that future contributors and partners understand the guardrails.

This roadmap will be revisited periodically (e.g. annually) and adjusted as the environment and resources change.
