These principles guide all product, content, and design decisions. They are non-negotiable for the core experience.

---

## 1. Trust first

- **Credibility over growth.** We prioritise being correct, cited, and honest over maximising traffic or engagement.
- **No fake urgency.** We do not use countdowns, “act now,” or fear-driven prompts to increase clicks or conversions.
- **Transparent boundaries.** We clearly state that we are not an official body and not an emergency service; we point to 112 and official sources for real-time emergencies.
- **Stable, predictable experience.** We avoid dark patterns, surprise paywalls, or misleading links. What we show is what we stand behind.

---

## 2. Official-source-based

- **Every claim traceable.** Preparedness advice must be traceable to an official or widely recognised authoritative source (e.g. AFAD, MGM, Kızılay, e-Devlet, 112).
- **Sources visible.** Each substantive page links to the relevant official pages; we do not hide or bury citations.
- **No original “expert” claims.** We do not pose as primary experts; we summarise and signpost. When we lack a clear official source, we say so or omit the claim.
- **Updates follow authorities.** When official guidance changes, we update our content and, where useful, note the date or nature of the change.

## 3. No fear-based content

- **Calm, factual tone.** We describe risks and steps in a calm, factual way. We do not use sensational language, worst-case dramatisation, or imagery intended to shock.
- **Empowerment, not anxiety.** The goal is to help people prepare, not to make them afraid. We emphasise “what you can do” and “where to find help.”
- **No fear-based monetisation.** We never use fear or urgency to promote products, donations, or ads. Any future commercial elements will follow our monetisation principles.

---

## 4. Clear separation between information and commerce

- **Editorial independence.** Preparedness content is not written or ordered to favour specific brands, products, or partners. Recommendations (if any) will follow our monetisation plan and be clearly labelled.
- **No pay-to-rank.** Paid relationships do not influence which preparedness steps or sources we show or how we rank them.
- **Obvious boundaries.** Any future affiliate links, sponsors, or ads will be visually and structurally separated from core “what to do” content and explained in a dedicated policy.

---

## 5. Accessibility and simplicity

- **Readable and scannable.** Language is simple and direct. Headings, lists, and short paragraphs make content easy to scan on mobile and desktop.
- **Functional on any device.** Core information works without JavaScript where possible; layout is mobile-first and responsive.
- **Inclusive by default.** We avoid jargon where possible, explain acronyms (e.g. AFAD, DASK), and aim for clarity for non-native speakers and low-literacy contexts.
- **Performance and stability.** We keep the site fast and reliable so it remains usable in low-bandwidth or high-stress situations.

These principles apply to the current site and to any future features, apps, or partnerships. Exceptions (e.g. temporary campaigns with partner approval) must be documented and aligned with the spirit of these principles.
