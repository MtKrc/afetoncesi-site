# Content standards — afetoncesi.com

**See also:** [MASTER_PRD.md](./MASTER_PRD.md) — North Star PRD and content/editorial expectations.

---

These standards apply to all editorial content on afetoncesi.com: articles, checklists, FAQs, meta descriptions, and any copy that represents the project. They support our product principles (trust first, official-source-based, no fear-based content) and long-term quality.

---

## Writing tone

- **Calm and factual.** Use clear, neutral language. Describe risks and steps without dramatising or alarming. Avoid words that suggest panic or inevitability (e.g. “disaster is coming,” “you must act now”).
- **Direct and actionable.** Prefer short sentences and concrete steps. Use “Do X” and “Do not do Y” where it helps clarity. Avoid long introductions; get to the point.
- **Respectful and inclusive.** Address the reader as “you” or “sizin” where appropriate. Avoid assumptions about family structure, ability, or language. When referring to official bodies, use their preferred names (e.g. AFAD, 112).
- **Consistent voice.** The site speaks as a single, reliable guide: helpful but not casual, authoritative but not bureaucratic. Jargon is explained on first use (e.g. “AFAD (Afet ve Acil Durum Yönetimi Başkanlığı)” or linked to a source).
- **No marketing speak.** We do not use superlatives (“best,” “#1”), fake scarcity, or emotional manipulation. We do not hype the site or its content.

## Citation rules

- **One source per claim.** Every substantive preparedness claim (what to do, what to avoid, what to have) must be traceable to an official or widely recognised authoritative source. Preferred sources include: AFAD, MGM, Kızılay, e-Devlet, 112, DASK, and equivalent government or official agencies.
- **Cite in context.** Each page or section that gives actionable advice should link to the relevant official page(s) in a visible “Resmi kaynaklar” / “Official sources” (or equivalent) block. Inline links are welcome where they directly support a sentence.
- **No unsupported claims.** If we cannot find an official or authoritative source for a claim, we do not publish it as fact. We may note “some sources suggest…” only when the source is named and the limitation is clear.
- **Stale or disputed guidance.** If official guidance has changed or is disputed, we update our text and, if useful, add a short note (e.g. “Updated following AFAD guidance, [date]”). We do not leave outdated advice in place once we know it has changed.
- **Attribution.** When we summarise or adapt content from an official source, we do not present it as our own. We say “based on…” or “AFAD recommends…” and link to the source.

## Update frequency

- **Trigger-based updates.** Content is updated when (1) we become aware of a change in official guidance, (2) a user or partner reports an error, or (3) we schedule a routine review (see below). We do not promise real-time updates; we promise reasonable diligence.
- **Routine review.** High-traffic and high-impact pages (e.g. deprem, acil çanta, toplanma alanı, main FAQs) should be reviewed at least once per year, or after a major disaster or policy change in Türkiye, to ensure links work and advice matches current official guidance.
- **Dates.** Where it adds trust, we show a “Son güncelleme” / “Last updated” date. That date is updated when substantive content or sources change, not on every tiny edit.
- **Archiving.** We do not delete outdated versions without replacing them with updated content or a clear notice. If a page is retired, we redirect or explain why.

## Review protocol

- **Pre-publish.** New or heavily revised content should be checked for: (1) accuracy against an official source, (2) tone (calm, no fear-based language), (3) correct links and citations, (4) alignment with product principles and this content-standards document.
- **Post-publish.** Errors reported by users or partners are triaged and corrected promptly. Obvious mistakes (wrong number, broken link, wrong agency name) are fixed as soon as possible; larger revisions follow the same pre-publish checks where feasible.
- **Ownership.** Someone must be named (in internal docs or on an “About” page) as responsible for content quality and for deciding when a source is acceptable. That person or role ensures the review protocol is applied.
- **Commerce and partnerships.** Any content that includes or is influenced by a commercial partner, affiliate, or sponsor must be reviewed specifically for compliance with the monetisation plan and separation of content and commerce. Such content will be clearly labelled.

## Exceptions and edge cases

- **Emergency or breaking events.** We do not provide real-time emergency advice. In a major event, we may point to 112 and official channels only; we do not rush to publish unverified updates.
- **Non-Türkiye contexts.** Our primary scope is Türkiye. If we mention other countries or regions, we cite a relevant authority and note the limitation.
- **Unofficial but useful sources.** In rare cases we may link to a non-official but reputable source (e.g. a university, Red Cross chapter) for supplementary information, with a clear label (e.g. “Additional reading”) so users understand it is not an official Turkish authority.

Changes to these standards will be documented; significant changes will be communicated to anyone who contributes or partners on content.
