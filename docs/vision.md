## Mission

afetoncesi.com exists to **reduce harm from disasters in Türkiye by making official, actionable preparedness information easy to find and use**. We do not replace official authorities or emergency services; we aggregate, simplify, and signpost their guidance so that individuals, families, and small communities can prepare calmly and effectively.

## Long-term vision (5 years)

Within five years, afetoncesi.com aims to be:

- **The go-to reference** for disaster preparedness in Turkish and English for Türkiye: trusted by the public, cited by institutions, and aligned with AFAD, MGM, and other official sources.
- **A neutral, non-commercial hub** that clearly separates “what to do” from “what to buy,” and never uses fear or urgency to drive engagement or revenue.
- **An accessible, evergreen resource** that stays current with official updates, covers major hazard types and life situations, and is usable on any device with minimal friction.
- **A foundation for a broader ecosystem** (e.g. tools, checklists, optional apps) that remains free at the core and committed to public benefit.

Success is measured by: sustained traffic to preparedness content, use by educators and community leaders, and feedback that the site is “clear, trustworthy, and actually useful when it matters.”

## Target audience

- **Primary:** Adults in Türkiye (and Turkish speakers abroad) who want to prepare for earthquakes, floods, fires, and other hazards but lack time or confidence to navigate multiple official sites. They value short, clear steps and official backing.
- **Secondary:** Families, renters, small businesses, and community organisers looking for shareable checklists and links to authorities (e.g. toplanma alanı, 112, AFAD).
- **Tertiary:** International audiences (e.g. residents, travellers, NGOs) who need English-language, Türkiye-specific preparedness information.

We do **not** primarily target: crisis moment (we are not an emergency response tool), highly technical or academic users, or audiences seeking entertainment or sensational content.

## Positioning

afetoncesi.com is a **nonprofit, public-benefit information platform**. We are not a government body, and we are not an emergency service. We:

- **Complement** official channels by making their guidance easier to discover and follow.
- **Do not** provide real-time emergency advice; we point to 112 and official sources for that.
- **Do not** sell preparedness as a product; we explain what matters and, when relevant, how to prepare (with clear separation from any future commerce).
- **Commit** to transparency: who we are, how we work, and how we may sustain the project (e.g. ethical monetisation) will be documented and kept separate from editorial content.

This positioning is reflected in our product principles, content standards, and roadmap.
