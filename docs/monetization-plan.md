# Monetization plan — afetoncesi.com

afetoncesi.com is a nonprofit, public-benefit information platform. This document sets out how we may sustain the project in the future without compromising trust, editorial independence, or user experience. **No monetisation is currently in place;** this plan is a policy framework for when and if we introduce revenue.

## Future product strategy

- **Core information stays free.** All essential preparedness content (what to do before/during/after hazards, official links, checklists, FAQs) remains free and accessible without registration or paywall.
- **Optional value-add only.** Any future paid or premium elements (e.g. printable packs, custom checklists, or donor perks) must be clearly optional and must not gate core safety information.
- **No pay-to-rank.** We do not accept payment to prioritise or feature specific preparedness steps, sources, or products in our main content. Sponsored or partner content (if any) will be explicitly labelled and separated.
- **Sustainability over profit.** Revenue goals are to cover costs (hosting, domain, optional tools, possible part-time coordination) and to keep the project stable and independent, not to maximise profit.

## Ethical affiliate model (if adopted)

If we ever use affiliate links (e.g. to retailers selling emergency kits, batteries, or other preparedness-related items):

- **Separation of content and links.** Affiliate links will not appear inside core “what to do” instructional blocks. They may appear only in a dedicated section (e.g. “Where to find these items” or “Suggested products”) that is clearly distinct from editorial steps.
- **Product-agnostic guidance first.** Our editorial content describes *what* to prepare (e.g. “water for 72 hours,” “battery-powered radio”) and *why*, without favouring specific brands. Affiliate links, if used, will point to categories or multiple options where possible, not to a single paid partner.
- **No fear-based promotion.** We will not use urgency, disaster imagery, or “last chance” messaging to encourage clicks on affiliate links. Descriptions will remain factual and calm.
- **Transparency.** We will publish a short “Support us” or “How we’re funded” page explaining that we may earn a small commission from some links and that this does not affect what we recommend in our editorial content. Affiliate relationships will not influence which items we list or how we describe them.
- **Review.** Any page or section that includes affiliate links will be subject to the same or stricter review as other content (see content-standards.md) to ensure compliance with this policy.

## Advertising principles (if adopted)

If we ever allow advertising:

- **No conflict with mission.** We will not run ads that contradict preparedness (e.g. promoting risky behaviour), exploit fear, or mimic official emergency services. We will not run ads for products or services that we would not mention in an editorial context (e.g. speculative or unverified “survival” products).
- **Clear separation.** Ads will be visually and structurally separated from editorial content. We will not use in-article native ads that blur the line between our content and paid messaging.
- **No targeting on sensitive data.** We will not use disaster-related or health-related user data for ad targeting in ways that could be perceived as exploitative. Any use of first-party data will be documented and minimised.
- **Preference for aligned partners.** We will prefer partners (e.g. NGOs, official campaigns, or responsible brands) whose messaging aligns with our principles. We reserve the right to refuse or remove ads that do not meet our standards.

## Separation of content and commerce

- **Single, public policy.** This monetisation plan is the single reference for how we handle revenue. All team members and partners must adhere to it.
- **Editorial independence.** Decisions about what to publish, how to phrase it, and which sources to cite are made for user benefit and accuracy, not for revenue. No sponsor, affiliate partner, or advertiser may dictate or alter core preparedness content.
- **Disclosure.** We will maintain a clear, findable explanation of how the project is funded (donations, grants, affiliate, ads, or none) and how that affects (or does not affect) content. We will update this document when monetisation is introduced or changed.
- **Review and enforcement.** At least annually, we will review actual practice against this plan and fix any drift. Violations (e.g. undisclosed paid placement, fear-based affiliate copy) will be treated as serious and corrected promptly.

---

## Current status

- **Revenue:** None. The project currently has no monetisation.
- **Costs:** Minimal (hosting, domain, volunteer or minimal labour). No paid advertising or affiliate links are in use.
- **Next steps:** Before introducing any form of revenue, we will (1) update this document with the specific mechanism and examples, (2) add or update a public “Support us / How we’re funded” page, and (3) ensure content-standards and product-principles are not compromised.

This plan may be revised as the project evolves; changes will be documented and, where significant, communicated to users.
